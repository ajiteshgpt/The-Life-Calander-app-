# ⏳ Life Calendar (For Android): Existential Crisis in 4K

> **"Visualize Time. Live Intentionally."**

**Visualize your life journey, annual progress, or personal goals through elegant, minimalist wallpaper grids. Life Calendar automatically transforms your device’s Home and Lock screens into a high-tech dashboard of time.**

Why look at a picture of your cat when you can stare at a pixel-perfect grid of how many weeks you have left before you become a memory?

## 🍎 The Android Evolution

**The definitive Life Calendar experience, built natively for Android.**

The **Life Calendar** philosophy—visualizing your life in weeks—is a famous stoic concept found on the web and iOS shortcuts. However, Android users have been stuck with messy widgets, complex wallpaper engines, or paid apps that drain battery.

**I solved that.**
This isn't just a widget; it's a seamless implementation of the Life Calendar aesthetic. I built a native Android engine that renders your timeline directly onto the wallpaper layer. No shortcuts, no configuration headaches, just a clean, automated interface that syncs with your life.

## 🚀 The Three Modes of Reality

### 1. 🧬 The Life Calendar (Existential Mode)
Visualizes your entire lifespan in a 52-column grid (one for every week of the year).

* **The Vibe:** Watching your HP bar deplete in a high-stakes RPG where there are no respawns.
* **Data Points:** Shows total weeks passed and your age in `Years : Months : Days`.
* **Tech Flex:** Automatically calculates expectancy based on an 80-year projection (adjustable if you plan on living forever).

</p>

### 2. 📅 The Year Calendar (Speedrun Mode)
A 365-dot grid tracking the current year.

* **The Vibe:** Realizing that January was 3 years ago and tomorrow is already December.
* **Customization:** Toggle between "Year Completed" (for the optimist) or "Year Left" (for the realist).

### 3. 🎯 The Goal Calendar (Productivity Mode)
A custom-dated grid for specific deadlines (Marathons, Placements, Exams, or that "Neural Networks" course you keep putting off).

* **The Vibe:** The digital equivalent of your mom standing behind you with a stopwatch.
* **Smart Logic:** Automatically defaults to today’s date but respects your right to manually change it.

## 🛠 Under the Hood (How I Built It)

I’m a CSE student (mostly dealing with AI/ML tensors), so naturally, I over-engineered this. I switched from training models to "vibe coding" Android views, letting my neural nets (and a few LLMs) handle the boilerplate while I focused on the logic:

### 🔋 Battery Optimization (The pOLED Advantage)
I run this on my own phone, so battery life was priority #1.
* **True Black (#000000):** I utilized **Physical Pixel Shutdown**. On devices like the Moto Edge 40 (or any OLED), black pixels literally turn off. The background consumes **0% battery**.
* **Memory Management:** I implemented strict bitmap recycling. Once the wallpaper is drawn, the app calls `recycle()` immediately to free up RAM. No bloat, no lag.

### ⏱ Precision Scheduling (Solving the Android Doze Issue)
Android loves to put apps to sleep to save power, which makes updating a wallpaper at exactly midnight tricky.
* **The Logic:** `PeriodicWorkRequest` is too inaccurate (it has a 15-minute flex window).
* **The Fix:** I used **Chained One-Time Requests** with millisecond calculations to ensure the update hits exactly at 12:00:01 AM.
* **WakeLocks:** I implemented a `PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK` for exactly 3 seconds during the update process so the CPU doesn't kill the drawing task halfway through.

### 📐 Curved Screen Optimization
* **The 60dp Buffer:** I noticed dots getting cut off on curved displays (like my Moto Edge). I added dynamic horizontal padding so the grid stays perfectly centered and visible, regardless of the screen curvature.
